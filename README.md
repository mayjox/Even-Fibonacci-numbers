# Even-Fibonacci-numbers
The sum of the even numbers in the fibonacci series not exceeding 4 million

<b>About The Project</b>

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. https://projecteuler.net/

This is the second problem in the series. The challenge was to find the sum of all even numbers in thefibonacci series up to 4 million. 

<b>Built with:</b>

The solution was built with Javascript ES6. Javascript concepts used:

while loop, conditional if and else statements, array

<b>What I learned:</b>

Break down problems into smaller units.

Be creative in the problem solving approach

I am learning how to write efficient code that uses less computing power.
